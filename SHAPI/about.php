                  <p align="justify" class="intro">Hello! I'm AniNeru and I'm an self-taught Digital Artist and Animator and also currently a College student. I also draw in various artstyles. My current artist name "AniNeru" formed because of the inspiration to peoples nickname to Kyoto Animation which is 'KyoAni'. Since I draw Anime, I thought that the japanese translation of my nickname "Neru" and "Ani short for 'Anime /Animation' are good together. But compared to the KyoAni nickname, I did it in vice versa which is now "AniNeru". My previous Artist names are NeruSan and Neruuu <br>&nbsp;<br>I started doing digital arts way back June 2020, I was introduced into 'Pinoy Animation' where I first watched "Asheru Animation" in Facebook Watch. I got entertained by his videos and inspire me to create and learn animation by myself. <br>&nbsp;<br> Since I was a kid, I am fascinated and amazed on Cartoons and Anime especially the cartoons and Anime TV Channels they show so when this opportunity came, it hit my interest. I joined the Internet Art Community in many social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and lately (the former Twitter) X. <br>&nbsp;<br>Now, I'm still learning to improve my artstyle through watching different artists that teaches fellow artists how to improve their artworks</p>
